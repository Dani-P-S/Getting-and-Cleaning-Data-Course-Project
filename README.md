Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================

The initial data set and the data set description is available at: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The run_analisys.R 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. The merged information files are stored in a new folder (/merged) using the same file names. 
- The descriptive activity names are used as name columns in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are stored. 
- From the data set of the previous step, second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject is created.


To run the code, the initial data set must be placed in the same directory than the file code.
